# What is TypeScript?

- TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types
- Strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript
- Supports a tight integration with your editor to allow you to catch errors
TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps
- Uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code
