# Why would TypeScript help you avoid production issues?

- You can catch potential type errors faster
- Forces you to be intentional about how youâ€™re structuring your code when you have to consider types
- Helps prevent someone from making changes without at least considering how it should be typed
- Helps with sweeping refactors
- Shows you very clearly where things are broken when a type is updated
