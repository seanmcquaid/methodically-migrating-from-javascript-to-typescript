# Type Declarations and Generics

## Type Declarations

*.d.ts* files can be used to declare global types, provide types to libraries that don't have them, or to provide types for libraries that are written in JavaScript.

## Generics

Generic type parameters can be used to create flexible functions, classes, and interfaces.

```typescript
const exampleGenericFunction: ExampleGenericFunction = <T>(arg: T) => {
  return arg;
};
```
