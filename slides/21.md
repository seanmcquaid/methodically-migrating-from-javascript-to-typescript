# Parting Thoughts

- JavaScript is awesome but TypeScript is AWESOME
- Improving the developer experience can positively impact users
- TypeScript can help prevent TypeError production issues
- Gradual migration is the way to approach a sweeping change like this
- Work on the lowest level of your application and move towards the stuff the user cares about
- Donâ€™t stress about being perfect, even getting most types correct is better than none
